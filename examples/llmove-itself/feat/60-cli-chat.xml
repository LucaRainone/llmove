    Create a function that manage a chat via CLI. `llmove chat` should return a welcome message and it should wait for user input.
    The context of the chat must be all the conventions.xml and root.xml in specs.
    A special system prompt file specs/chat.xml may be present and used as context.
    Once the user send input, the conversation starts: after the AI response, the cli should wait for other user input and keep the history.
    Write it in lib/chat.js.
    use the openai sdk in order to manage stream data.
    this is the current api.js for sending data to claude, I think it's better to refactor it supporting also stream and using sdk
